# External Repository Intake V2 — Finite-Domain Governance

Status: **SOURCE RESEARCH INTAKE ONLY / NOT DEPENDENCY / NOT CONTROL / NOT INSTALLED**

This is the bounded current-main successor to the external-intake surface represented by VCP PR #89.

PR #89 correctly blocked several literal promotion phrases, but its authority boundary still depended on natural-language blacklists. Hostile review reproduced equivalent promotions by changing wording and by using the structured lifecycle field.

V2 removes prose from normative action semantics.

Normative repository fields are finite-domain values:
- lifecycle;
- disposition;
- destination;
- restriction classes;
- pattern IDs;
- evidence mode.

Follow-ups are structured objects containing only:
- a finite `action_kind`;
- a finite research/history destination;
- finite pattern IDs.

The validator freezes the domain definitions themselves and each repository's full normative profile, including license observation, lifecycle, disposition, patterns, destination, restrictions, evidence mode, and evidence tuples. Adding or changing any of those values is therefore a new source subject rather than an unreviewed in-domain downgrade.

Human-readable explanations remain documentation. They are not parsed to infer admission, authority, installation, routing, memory, provider state, or effects.

The exact forbidden-effect set remains:
`DEPENDENCY_ADMISSION | PROJECT_INSTALL | RUNTIME_ROUTE | MEMORY_ADMISSION | CONTROL_OWNERSHIP | PROVIDER_MUTATION | NETWORK_DEPLOYMENT | POLITICAL_POSITION_INGESTION | LICENSE_COMPATIBILITY_APPROVAL | MERGE_AUTHORITY`.

Additional fail-closed rules include:
- unresolved license requires `NO_CODE_REUSE`;
- archived/stale evidence remains historical and carries `PRESERVE_HISTORICAL_ONLY`;
- content-corpus evidence stays `NONE_BY_DEFAULT` and carries `CONTENT_POSITION_NONADOPTION`;
- VeraMesh destinations require explicit owner-subsystem review;
- follow-up action/destination combinations are finite and cross-checked; each follow-up pattern must retain the research destination bound by its source repository profile;
- immutable evidence paths reject traversal and malformed blobs;
- repository identities and exact observed heads are frozen to this snapshot.

This source does not admit any external repository as a Vera dependency, control source, Project source, memory, current route, runtime dependency, political position, license-approved code source, or effect authority.

No merge, Project install/settings/source mutation, provider mutation, credential/permission change, runtime activation, memory admission, network deployment, or paid effect is authorized by this source.
