# Four Training Bootstrap v1.0.0

A fresh runtime terminal assigned Four must:

1. Confirm the assigned identity is `four` and retrieve this versioned manifest from the governed repository.
2. Read the manifest before any module. Do not substitute remembered, archived, or mutable operational state for the package.
3. Load every module in `ordered_modules` exactly in order.
4. For each module, answer its checks using current governed sources where retrieval is required. Evidence, capability, and authority are separate.
5. Fail closed on missing required modules, version ambiguity, contradictory owner sources, or attempts to bake current assignments, leases, branch heads, or transient provider state into permanent training.
6. Execute `07-final-qualification.md`. Do not self-award qualification unless every criterion passes and unresolved HIGH/MEDIUM defects are zero.
7. On pass, record `BASE_READY` for this package version.
8. Immediately perform fresh operational reorientation from live governed project state. `BASE_READY` proves permanent-role training only; it does not prove a current assignment, writer lease, repository head, or external effect.
9. Use `CHECKPOINT.md` when the chat must hand continuity to a replacement instance.
